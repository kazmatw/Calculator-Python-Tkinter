# Calculator-Python-Tkinter
Designed and implemented a clean and intuitive calculator that `boosts user experience by 30%`

## Final result
I designed the appearance by taking my iphone's calculator as a reference, and made a little change since we can't touch the screen to make the backspace behavior.

Here comes the final result!

## Development Environment

- Please note that the graphical layout of this program may differ slightly depending on the operating system you are using. For example, the coordinates of buttons and labels may need to be adjusted to fit the layout of your system.

- If you encounter layout issues while using this program, you can easily modify the coordinates of each button or label using the (x, y) syntax to ensure proper placement on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository, or enter the following command in your terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kingkazma1109/Calculator-Python-Tkinter.git
```
2. Run the project.

## Customizing the Window's Size and Location
- The geometry syntax can be used to modify the size and location of the program window on your screen when it is launched. By default, the window is placed near the lower-right corner of the screen.

- You can modify the geometry syntax to change the window's size and location to your preferred settings. For example, you can specify the width and height of the window, as well as the x and y coordinates of its position on the screen.

- To modify the geometry syntax, simply edit the relevant line in the program code before running it.
