# calculator-python-tkinter
This is a project about making a calculator by tkinter which is a GUI tool of python
## Final result
I designed the appearance by taking my iphone's calculator as a reference, and made a little change since we can't touch the screen to make the backspace behavior.

Here comes the final result!

## More detailed instructions
### Operating System
My system is manjaro linux, so its layout may have some difference according to the system you used.

If you want to fix this problem, you can simply modify the coordinate in place(x,y) syntax in each button or label.
### Geometry Syntax
The geometry syntax is to modify the window's size and the location on your screen when you run it.

Currently, I just put it near to the lower right corner on my screen.
